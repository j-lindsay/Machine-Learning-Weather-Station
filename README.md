# Machine-Learning-Weather-Station

Team project for my university's Operating Systems class. The data used for analysis is collected via a rasberry pi with the Sense HAT module, which continually collects data in a specific interval (for example, every 15 minutes). Once done, the pi sends a csv to another computer with more processing power and computes models using neural network regression to predict weather characteristics (temperature, pressure, humidity). Some example results are listed below, where the relation between test and validate describe the accuracy of the model at mapping a trend.
