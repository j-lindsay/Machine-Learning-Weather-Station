# Machine-Learning-Weather-Station

Team project for my university's Operating Systems class. The data used for analysis is collected via a rasberry pi with the Sense HAT module, which continually collects data in a specific interval (for example, every 15 minutes). Once done, the pi sends a csv to another computer with more procesdsing power and computes models using neural network regression to predict weather characteristics (temperature, pressure, humidity).
